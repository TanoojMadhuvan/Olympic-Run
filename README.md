This game was created by Tanooj Kanike.

In order to play the game, download the Olympic_Run_Play.zip.zip file. 
Unzip the folder and then open the application file (".exe") not the ".pck" file.
Make sure that the application and the .pck file are in the same folder at all times.

The scripts folder contains all the code written by Tanooj Kanike using GDScript.
GDScript is a unique language used exclusively to program in the Godot gaming engine.

All assets were found open-source and free to use. This includes the fonts, 3D textures, and sounds.
They can be found in the assets folder.

The scenes folder consists of Godot scenes and code created by the gaming engine, not the programmer.

Warning: Volume may be a bit loud, but you can turn it down.
Mouse sensitivity can be adjusted in the settings.

The game is not meant to be played in full-screen and can not be paused
as it was tested to be worse for user-experience.
